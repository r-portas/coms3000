# Tutorial 12: Wireless, Cloud and Industrial Control Systems

## Q1

There are 16 DSSS channels, looking at the diagram we can see that the channels 1, 2, 3 and 13 are available.

## Q2: Failures of WEP

Main Failures of WEP:
- One way authentication
- Static WEP keys
- Key Vulnerabilities
- Weak IV

## Q3

Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining, an encryption protocol for wireless that implements 802.11i. Focusses on data confidentiality

Encryption protocol is in the IEEE 802.11i RSN

Only in WPA2, not WPA

## Q4: Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- __Broad Network Access__: Resources and services available over a network
- __On Demand Self Service__: Services can be provisioned without minimal human interaction
- __Multi Tenancy__: Multiple independent instances of one of multiple applications
- __Resource Pooling__: Resrouces are aggregated to serve one or more customer
- __Rapid Elasticity__: Resources can be quickly provisioned and released, possibly appear unlimited
- __Measured Service__: Similar to water and electricity bills

## Q5: Can Stuxnet be stopped by changing all the default passwords

If the user changes the default password then the Industrial Control System will cease to function, since the credentials are hardcoded into the software.

Yes, it can stop it but the system won't work because it can't access the database.
