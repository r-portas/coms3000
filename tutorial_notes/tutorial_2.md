# Tutorial 2: Risk Management

A widget manufacturer has installed new network servers, changing its network
from a peer-to-peer network to a client/server-
based network. The network consists of 100 users who make an 
average of $40 an hour for the company, working on 100 workstations. Previously, none of the 
workstations involved in the network had anti-virus so
ftware installed on the machines. This was 
because the workstations didn’t have floppy disk drives or Internet connectivity, so the risk of 
viruses was deemed minimal. 
One of the new servers provides a broadband connection to the Internet, which employeescan 
now use to send and receive email. One of the managers read in a trade magazine that other 
widget companies have reported an 80 percent chance of viruses infecting their network within 
year after connecting it to the Internet. The magazine also mentio
ned that it may take upwards of 
three hours to restore data that’s been damaged or destroyed. 
A vendor will sell licensed copies of anti-
virus software for all servers and the 100 workstations at a 
cost of $4,700 per year. The company has asked you to det
ermine the annual loss that can be 
expected from viruses, and determine if it is beneficial in terms of cost to purchase licensed copies 
of anti-virus software.

## Question
- What is the Annualised Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for this risk?
- Calculate the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) for this risk.
- Calculate the Annualised Loss Expectancy.
- Determine whether it is beneficial in terms of monetary value to purchase the anti-virus software by calculating how much money would be saved or lost by purchasing the 
so
ftware.

## Answer

Annualized rate of Occurrence: 0.8

Total profit for each operational hour: $40 x 100 = $4000

Single Loss Expectancy: $4000 x 3 = $12000

Annualized Loss Expectancy: $9600

Annual cost of antivirus solution: $4700

Thus it is cheaper to buy the antivirus solution. The company will save $4900
