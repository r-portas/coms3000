	abstract = {Cloud computing is a whole new paradigm that offers a non-traditional computing model for organizations to adopt Information Technology and related functions and aspects without upfront investment and with lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Cloud computing opens doors to multiple, unlimited venues from elastic computing to on demand provisioning to dynamic storage and computing requirement fulfillment. However, despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the security of an open-ended and rather freely accessible resource is still questionable which impacts the cloud adoption. The security problem becomes amplified under the cloud model as new dimensions enter into the problem scope related to the architecture, multi-tenancy, layer dependency, and elasticity. This paper introduces a detailed analysis of the cloud security problem. It investigates the problem of security from the cloud architecture perspective, the cloud characteristics perspective, cloud delivery model perspective, and the cloud stakeholder perspective. The paper investigates some of the key research challenges of implementing cloud-aware security solutions which can plausibly secure the ever-changing and dynamic cloud model. Based on this analysis it presents a derived detailed specification of the cloud security problem and key features that should be covered by any proposed security solution for cloud computing.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has created a remarkable paradigm shift in the IT industry and brought several advantages such as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. These advantages enabled cloud to have significant impact on different sectors of smart cites. However, cloud adoption has increased the sophistication of the ever changing security risks which frustrate enterprises on expanding their on-premises infrastructure towards cloud horizons. These risks have the potential of being a major concern for smart cities due to the increasing impact of cloud on them. Managing these security risks requires adopting effective risk management method which involve both the cloud service provider and the customer. The risk management frameworks currently applied to manage enterprise IT risks do not readily fit the cloud environment and the dynamic nature of clouds, which are characterized by on demand self-service and rapid elasticity. Therefore, researchers have proposed different cloud security risk management methods and frameworks. This paper critically reviews these risk management methods and frameworks. In addition, it conducts critical analysis on two of them using qualitative content analysis technique, and evaluates their effectiveness for assessing and mitigating cloud security risks.},

Enterprise Cloud computing has established its businesses and software as a service paradigm is increasing its demand for more services. However, this new trend needs to be more systematic with respect to Enterprise Cloud security. Enterprise Cloud security is the key factor in sustaining Enterprise Cloud technology by building-in trust. For example, current challenges that are witnessed today with cyber security and application security flaws are important lessons to be learned. It also has provided best practices that can be adapted. Similarly, as the demand for Enterprise Cloud services increases and so increased importance sought for security and privacy. This paper presents recommendations for enterprise security to analyze and model Enterprise Cloud organizational security of the Enterprise Cloud and its data. In particular, Enterprise Cloud data and Enterprise Cloud storage technologies have become more commonly used in organization that adopt Cloud Computing.

	abstract = {The degradation of the security of password-based mechanisms, combined with the increasing number of perils on the Internet, is rendering one-factor authentication outdated. This threatens the security of online operations for enterprises and end users, and consequently affects cloud computing solutions. Although cloud computing provides appealing benefits in terms of costs reduction, while increasing productivity, it introduces uncharted security issues (e.g., see [1]) beyond the ones inherited from the Internet. The emergence of mobile computing also makes authentication a priority, and has been reinforcing the need to build stronger and more resilient mechanisms; and simultaneously providing the means to develop new authentication mechanisms, namely Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) schemes. The convergence to Single Sign-On (SSO) models is being used to eliminate or decrease password management complexity. MFA mostly appears in the form of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) mechanisms based on One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for the second factor after standard password authentication. Such mechanisms can be based on public-key cryptography and may resort to several technologies to improve user experience, namely Quick Response (QR) codes, Short Message Service (SMSes), Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), or even contactless Near Field Communication (NFC). Another trend leans to the adoption of risk-based authentication. Efforts for securing authentication are mainly being undertaken by the Initiative for Open AuTHentication (OATH) and the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) alliance.},

	abstract = {Cloud API (Application Programming Interface) enables client applications to access services and manage resources hosted in the Cloud. To protect themselves and their customers, Cloud service providers (CSP) often require client authentication for each API call. The authentication usually depends on some kind of secret (or called API key), for example, secret access key, password, or access token. As such, the API key unlocks the door to the treasure inside the Cloud. Hence, protecting these keys is critical. It is a difficult task especially on the client side, such as users' computers or mobile devices. How do CSPs authenticate client applications? What are security risks of managing API keys in common practices? How can we mitigate these risks? This paper focuses on finding answers to these questions. By reviewing popular client authentication methods that CSPs use and using Cloud APIs as software developers, we identified various security risks associated with API keys. To mitigate these risks, we use hardware secure elements for secure key provisioning, storage, and usage. The solution replaces the manual key handling with end-to-end security between CSP and its customers' secure elements. This removes the root causes of the identified risks and enhances API security. It also enhances the usability by eliminating manual key operations and alleviating software developers' worries of working with cryptography.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing enabled by virtualization technology exhibits revolutionary change in IT Infrastructure. Hypervisor is a pillar of virtualization and it allows sharing of resources to virtual machines. Vulnerabilities present in virtual machine leveraged by an attacker to launch the advanced persistent attacks such as stealthy rootkit, Trojan, Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack etc. Virtual Machines are prime target for malignant cloud user or an attacker to launch attacks as they are easily available for rent from Cloud Service Provider (CSP). Attacks on virtual machine can disrupt the normal operation of cloud infrastructure. In order to secure the virtual environment, defence mechanism is highly imperative at each virtual machine to identify the attacks occurring at virtual machine in timely manner. This work proposes In-and-Out-of-the-Box Virtual Machine and Hypervisor based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for virtualized environment to ensure robust state of the virtual machine by detecting followed by eradicating rootkits as well as other attacks. We conducted experiments using popular open source Host based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) called Open Source SECurity Event Correlator (OSSEC). Both Linux and windows based rootkits, DoS attack, Files integrity verification test are conducted and they are successfully detected by OSSEC.},

	abstract = {Cloud is becoming a dominant computing platform. Naturally, a question that arises is whether we can beat notorious DDoS attacks in a cloud environment. Researchers have demonstrated that the essential issue of DDoS attack and defense is resource competition between defenders and attackers. A cloud usually possesses profound resources and has full control and dynamic allocation capability of its resources. Therefore, cloud offers us the potential to overcome DDoS attacks. However, individual cloud hosted servers are still vulnerable to DDoS attacks if they still run in the traditional way. In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource allocation strategy to counter DDoS attacks against individual cloud customers. When a DDoS attack occurs, we employ the idle resources of the cloud to clone sufficient intrusion prevention servers for the victim in order to quickly filter out attack packets and guarantee the quality of the service for benign users simultaneously. We establish a mathematical model to approximate the needs of our resource investment based on queueing theory. Through careful system analysis and real-world data set experiments, we conclude that we can defeat DDoS attacks in a cloud environment.},

	abstract = {The emerging cloud market introduces a multitude of cloud service providers, making it difficult for consumers to select providers who are likely to be a low risk from a security perspective. Recently, significant emphasis has arisen on the need to specify Service Level Agreements that address security concerns of consumers (referred to as SecSLAs) – these are intended to clarify security support in addition to Quality of Service characteristics associated with services. It has been found that such SecSLAs are not consistent among providers, even though they offer services with similar functionality. However, measuring security service levels and the associated risk plays an important role when choosing a cloud provider. Data breaches have been identified as a high priority threat influencing the adoption of cloud computing. This paper proposes a general analysis framework which can compute risk associated with data breaches based on pre-agreed SecSLAs for different cloud providers. The framework exploits a tree based structure to identify possible attack scenarios that can lead to data breaches in the cloud and a means of assessing the use of potential mitigation strategies to reduce such breaches.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is a computing paradigm shift where computing is moved away from personal computers or an individual server to a cloud of computers. Its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and dynamically re-allocation of resources as per demand make it desirable. At an unprecedented pace, cloud computing has simultaneously transformed business and government, and created new security challenges such as data breaches, data loss, account hijacking and denial of service. Paramount among these security threats is data breaches. The proposed work is to prevent data breaching threat by way of providing user authentication through one-time password system and challenge response, risk assessment to identify and prevent possible risks, encryption using enhanced elliptic curve cryptography where a cryptographically secure random number generation is used to make the number unpredictable, data integrity using MD5 technique, and key management. The platform for deployment of the application is Google App Engine.},
