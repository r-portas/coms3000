	abstract = {Cloud computing is a whole new paradigm that offers a non-traditional computing model for organizations to adopt Information Technology and related functions and aspects without upfront investment and with lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Cloud computing opens doors to multiple, unlimited venues from elastic computing to on demand provisioning to dynamic storage and computing requirement fulfillment. However, despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the security of an open-ended and rather freely accessible resource is still questionable which impacts the cloud adoption. The security problem becomes amplified under the cloud model as new dimensions enter into the problem scope related to the architecture, multi-tenancy, layer dependency, and elasticity. This paper introduces a detailed analysis of the cloud security problem. It investigates the problem of security from the cloud architecture perspective, the cloud characteristics perspective, cloud delivery model perspective, and the cloud stakeholder perspective. The paper investigates some of the key research challenges of implementing cloud-aware security solutions which can plausibly secure the ever-changing and dynamic cloud model. Based on this analysis it presents a derived detailed specification of the cloud security problem and key features that should be covered by any proposed security solution for cloud computing.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has created a remarkable paradigm shift in the IT industry and brought several advantages such as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. These advantages enabled cloud to have significant impact on different sectors of smart cites. However, cloud adoption has increased the sophistication of the ever changing security risks which frustrate enterprises on expanding their on-premises infrastructure towards cloud horizons. These risks have the potential of being a major concern for smart cities due to the increasing impact of cloud on them. Managing these security risks requires adopting effective risk management method which involve both the cloud service provider and the customer. The risk management frameworks currently applied to manage enterprise IT risks do not readily fit the cloud environment and the dynamic nature of clouds, which are characterized by on demand self-service and rapid elasticity. Therefore, researchers have proposed different cloud security risk management methods and frameworks. This paper critically reviews these risk management methods and frameworks. In addition, it conducts critical analysis on two of them using qualitative content analysis technique, and evaluates their effectiveness for assessing and mitigating cloud security risks.},

Enterprise Cloud computing is a new paradigm for that enterprise where businesses need to be secured. Enterprise Cloud computing has established its businesses and software as a service paradigm is increasing its demand for more services. However, this new trend needs to be more systematic with respect to Enterprise Cloud security. Enterprise Cloud security is the key factor in sustaining Enterprise Cloud technology by building-in trust. For example, current challenges that are witnessed today with cyber security and application security flaws are important lessons to be learned. It also has provided best practices that can be adapted. Similarly, as the demand for Enterprise Cloud services increases and so increased importance sought for security and privacy. This paper presents recommendations for enterprise security to analyze and model Enterprise Cloud organizational security of the Enterprise Cloud and its data. In particular, Enterprise Cloud data and Enterprise Cloud storage technologies have become more commonly used in organization that adopt Cloud Computing. Therefore, building trust for Enterprise Cloud users should be the one of the main focuses of Enterprise Cloud computing research.},

	doi = {10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742763},
	abstract = {The degradation of the security of password-based mechanisms, combined with the increasing number of perils on the Internet, is rendering one-factor authentication outdated. This threatens the security of online operations for enterprises and end users, and consequently affects cloud computing solutions. Although cloud computing provides appealing benefits in terms of costs reduction, while increasing productivity, it introduces uncharted security issues (e.g., see [1]) beyond the ones inherited from the Internet. The emergence of mobile computing also makes authentication a priority, and has been reinforcing the need to build stronger and more resilient mechanisms; and simultaneously providing the means to develop new authentication mechanisms, namely Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) schemes. The convergence to Single Sign-On (SSO) models is being used to eliminate or decrease password management complexity. MFA mostly appears in the form of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) mechanisms based on One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for the second factor after standard password authentication. Such mechanisms can be based on public-key cryptography and may resort to several technologies to improve user experience, namely Quick Response (QR) codes, Short Message Service (SMSes), Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), or even contactless Near Field Communication (NFC). Another trend leans to the adoption of risk-based authentication. Efforts for securing authentication are mainly being undertaken by the Initiative for Open AuTHentication (OATH) and the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) alliance.},

	doi = {10.1109/CLOUD.2014.143},
	abstract = {Cloud API (Application Programming Interface) enables client applications to access services and manage resources hosted in the Cloud. To protect themselves and their customers, Cloud service providers (CSP) often require client authentication for each API call. The authentication usually depends on some kind of secret (or called API key), for example, secret access key, password, or access token. As such, the API key unlocks the door to the treasure inside the Cloud. Hence, protecting these keys is critical. It is a difficult task especially on the client side, such as users' computers or mobile devices. How do CSPs authenticate client applications? What are security risks of managing API keys in common practices? How can we mitigate these risks? This paper focuses on finding answers to these questions. By reviewing popular client authentication methods that CSPs use and using Cloud APIs as software developers, we identified various security risks associated with API keys. To mitigate these risks, we use hardware secure elements for secure key provisioning, storage, and usage. The solution replaces the manual key handling with end-to-end security between CSP and its customers' secure elements. This removes the root causes of the identified risks and enhances API security. It also enhances the usability by eliminating manual key operations and alleviating software developers' worries of working with cryptography.},
