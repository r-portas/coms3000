3. Software as a Service (Application Capabilities Type)

## Industrial Control Systems

### Security Assessments
- Select all security controls that are assigned to the selected baseline
- Remove any security controls that are not relevant to the system being assessed
- Security controls belonging to higher baselines may be included
