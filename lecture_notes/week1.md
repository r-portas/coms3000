# Week 1

## Security

- Security: The quality or state of being secure
- Secure: Free from risk of loss

## Dealing with Risk

- Accept it
- Transfer it
    - i.e. Insurance
- Mitigate it
    - i.e. Sprinkler system

## Types of Protective Measures

- Preventative Measures
- Detective Measures
- Reactive Measures 
## Security of Information Systems

- Confidentiality
    - Prevention of unauthorised disclosure of information
- Integrity
    - Prevention of unauthorised modification of information
- Availability
    - Prevention of unauthorised withholding of information or services
- Authenticity
    - Making sure the author is who they say they are
- Non-repudiation
    - Ensures that somebody did what they said

## Risk Management

- Economic balance between impact of risks and the cost of protective measures

## Risk Definition

- The likelihood that a particular __threat__ using a specific attack, will exploit a particular __vulnerability__ of a system that results in an undesirable consequence.

## Threat Definition

- Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to an information system in the form of destruction, disclosure, adverse modification of data and/or the denial of service.

## Vulnerability Definition

- Weakness in an information system, cryptographic system or other components that could be exploited by a threat.

## Risk Assessment

- A process of analysing __threats__ to and __vulnerabilties__ of an information system and the __potential impact__ the loss of information or capabilities of a system would have. 
- The resulting analysis is used as a basis for identifying appropriate and cost effective counter measures.

## Risk Management

- IT Manager have limited resources to spend on security
- Risk Management helps to determine how these resource can be used most efficiently.

## Quantitative Risk Analysis

- We would like some quantitative description of Risk (or Risk Magnitude)
- `Risk = Expected Cost of Damage = Impact * Likelihood`

- Two Main Questions
    - What's the problem of loss event occurring?
        - Can be based on historical data
    - What's the impact (loss) in terms of $

## Quantitative Risk Analysis Parameters

- ARO (Annualised Risk Occurance)
    - Expected number of items a loss even occurs within a year
- SLE (Single Loss Expectency)
    - The impact (loss) of a loss event occurring in $
- ALE (Annualised Loss Expectancy)
    - Expected (average) loss per year due to a Risk
    - `ALE = ARO * SLE`
    - ALE can serve as a measure of Risk exposure

## Quantitative vs Qualitative Risk Analysis
- In practice, it is often difficult to:
    - Assign probabilities to loss events
    - Quantify the cost/impact of loss events
- Often, qualitative methods are used
- If Risks cannot be qualified, they are often ranked: highest to lowest
