## Network Layer Security
- Perimeter Security
- DMZs
- Segmentation
- Physical Security
- Intrusion Detection
- Incident Response
- Business Continuity
- Disaster Recovery

## Network Security
- Firewall at each Internet Connection and between any DMZ and the internal zones
- Current diagram that identifies all connections, including wireless networks
- Changes to Network connections
- Changes to firewall and router configurations
- Groups, roles and responsibilities for management of network components
- Firewall and router configuration standards
- Business justification for use of all services, protocols and ports allowed
- Identify insecure services, protocols and ports allowed
- Documentation of security features implemented for those protocols considered to be insecure
- Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary
- __Specifically deny all other traffic__
- Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only components that provide authorised publicly accessible services
- Secure and synchronize router configuration files
- Review firewall and router rule sets at least every six months

## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
- __Disaster Recovery__: Goal is to minimise the effects of a disaster and take the necessary steps to ensure that the resources, personnel and business processes are able to resume operations in a timely manner.

- __Business Continuity Planning__: Provides methods and procedures for dealing with longer term outages and disasters

- _Remember__: Although _availability_ may have been compromised, _integrity_ and _confidentiality_ must continue to be maintained.

1. Business Impact Analysis
2. Recovery Strategy
3. Plan design and development
